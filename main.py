    Select up to k patient names in the order they should be called.

    Patients are dictionaries with:
      - "name": string
      - "severity": integer 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent)
      - "arrival_order": integer, smaller means arrived earlier

    Priority rules:
      1. Lower severity number first.
      2. If severity ties, lower arrival_order first.

    Return a list of names in the correct order. If k is 0 or there are
    no patients, return [].
